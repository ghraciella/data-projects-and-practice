<span style="color:green"> __Project :__  </span> [`Accenture Virtual Experience - Data Analytics and Visualization`](https://github.com/ghraciella/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Experience)


<span style="color:green"> __Description :__   </span> This project involves identifying the client’s business problem based on the brief and datasets provided, it also involved use of the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process. I also created a dashboard with several visualizations using Power BI in order to
get insights, make my analysis and give my recommendations.

<span style="color:green">  __Tech Stack :__  </span> Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

<span style="color:green"> __Skills:__  </span>  Business and Data understanding, ETL, statistical data analysis, data visualization.

<span style="color:green"> __Project :__  </span>  [`Visual Perception - Segmentation and Depth Estimation Networks`](https://github.com/ghraciella/Visual-Perception-Segmentation-and-Depth-Estimation-Networks)


<span style="color:green"> __Description :__   </span> The project involves the implementation of a segmentation network to classify desired road participants on a pixel-based level and also the implementation of a depth estimation network for estimating the depth (distance) of road objects in
images and video data using Python, Pytorch and its related
libraries.

<span style="color:green">  __Tech Stack :__  </span> Python,  Numpy, Pandaas,  Matplotlib, OpenCV, Pytorch, Pytorch Ligthning.

<span style="color:green"> __Skills:__  </span> Computer vision, Image processing, Neural Networks, Data Science.

<span style="color:green"> __Project :__  </span>  [`Goldman Sachs Virtual Experience - Excel Business Project`](https://github.com/ghraciella/Goldman-Sachs-Excel-Business-Virtual-Experience-Project)


<span style="color:green"> __Description :__   </span> This project involves the creation forecast operating assumptions for the client’s revenue, costs and cashflow, translated the set of forecasted assumptions and used it to build the profit and loss (P&L) forecast statements. Utilized the cash flow assumptions
alongside the P&L forecast to complete the cash flow
analysis and used the forecasted cash flow analysis to
calculate a closing cash balance for each period.
Creating output charts in excel to show insights on how
the business will perform over the next 5 years.
