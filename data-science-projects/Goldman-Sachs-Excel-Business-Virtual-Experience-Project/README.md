For last task, I used Excel charts to provide insights for financial years 2020 to 2024 on the cupcake volume, revenue forecast for all products (cupcakes, icecream and drinks), cash forecast, debt forecast. 

The 4 different types of charts created were the:

<li> Column Chart </li>
<li> Line Chart </li>
<li> Area Chart </li>
<li> Combo Chart (Column and Line) </li>
